# PigLatinParser

Language parser I wrote using flex and bison.

Used Flex 2.5.4 and Bison 2.4.1 plus visual studios 2017 to create this project.

Files loaded must have an empty line at the end to work correctly.

Project:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We ask you to write a language parser based on a high-level language called pig-latin
(http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/docs/r0.3.0/piglatin.html). This language is currently used by hadoop
clustered file system to simplify the creation of map-reduce application.
For the purpose of this interview, we simplify the language specification so that it can be solved in a
short time.
The simplified language has several criteria, as follows:
● Each line, except when it’s a blank line, should represent a complete statement. There will be no
incomplete statement within a line.
● All keywords/identifiers are case insensitive.
● Assume that all the inputs are in the correct syntax. You don’t need to check for syntax error.
The language has some reserved keywords:

LOAD Load data from a file.
File specification:
● The file has to be in comma delimited format.
● Every row has to have the same number of column.
● Each element are integers, ranging between -100000 to 100000
Example usage:
a = load abc.csv

DUMP Dump the content of a variable.
Example usage:
a = load abc.csv
dump a
Example output:
1,2,2
2,2,3
5,1,3
3,4,5

FILTER - BY Select each row from a variable that matches the criteria. The criteria are
defined by comparing a column identifier with a specific value. The column
identifier is always started with $ followed by the column number. The
supported operator is >, >=, ==, <=, <.
Example usage:

a = load abc.csv
b = filter a by $0 > 2
DUMP b
Example output:
5,1,3
3,4,5

FOREACH - GENERATE Process each variable, and construct a new data from it.
Example usage:
a = load abc.csv
b = foreach a generate $0 + 1, $1 * 2
DUMP b
Example output:
2,4
3,4
6,2
4,8

Please write a python code to implement this parser, and if possible, write the unit-test for your code as
well.
Other Example
Example CSV myfile.csv:
1,3,5,2,4
2,3,4,1,2
1,2,3,5,7
3,3,3,3,3
Example pig script:
A = load myfile.csv
Dump a
B = foreach a generate $0, $0 * 2, $1
Dump b
C = filter b by $2 < 3
Dump c
Example output:
1,3,5,2,4
2,3,4,1,2
1,2,3,5,7
3,3,3,3,3
1,2,3
2,4,3
1,2,2
3,6,3
1,2,2
